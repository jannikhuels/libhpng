# HYPEG
HYPEG (formerly libhpng) is a Java library provided for the simulation of Hybrid Petri nets with general transitions (HPnG). These are specifically tailored towards so-called fluid critical infrastructures with the aim to model discrete, continuous and stochastic behavior . HYPEG supports discrete-event simulation of HPnG models.
The main idea of HYPEG is described in our papers on [Statistical Model Checking for hybrid Petri nets with
multiple general transitions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8023146/) and [HYPEG: Statistical Model Checking for hybrid Petri nets](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3150956).

## How to get started?
Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jannikhuels/libhpng/wiki) on how to get started with HYPEG.

## Download
You can either clone this repository and import the Java Maven project (including a shell for user input) or you can use the provided jar-files in the folder *stable versions* (hypeg_1.0.jar or hypeg_2.0.jar) and include it in your Java project.

## Who is responsible for the HYPEG project?
The project *HYPEG* is organized by the group of [safety-critical systems](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Informatik.AGRemke/en/index.html) which is part of the institute of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Westfälischen Wilhelms-Universität Münster and lead by Prof. Dr. Anne Remke.

## What is currently supported by HYPEG?
+ hypeg_1.0.jar: Discrete-event simulation for HPnGs with multiple general transitions.
+ hypeg_2.0.jar: Discrete-event simulation for HPnGs with multiple general transitions and non-linear continuous behavior (see [wiki](https://github.com/jannikhuels/libhpng/wiki) for details).
